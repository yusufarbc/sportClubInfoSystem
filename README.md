## Getting Started

In this project I did as a web-based programming course assignment; HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, php and mySQL technologies were used. The purpose of the project: to develop a website for a sports club where sportsmans can log in and view themselves profile,  which will promote the sports club to other users. For updates in the sites, an admin panel is developed.

### Prerequisites

To run this application on your own computer, you need an apache server and a mySQL server. You can use xampp tool which provides all of these for you. You can download and install the program from this link: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html


### Installing
For the application installed, first make sure that apache and mySQL servers are running smoothly on xampp.

![xampp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77548038/174430805-8d2922b1-23a9-4e4d-9951-76b097857905.png)   

1- Run Apache and mySQL servers via xampp. The background color turns green when the servers are running.
  
2- Open phpMyAdmin in your browser. For this, you need to write http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your browser's address bar.
  
3- Create a new schema named phpProject.

4- Go to the SQL section and copy and run the codes in sql/db.sql on github. With this process, your database will be ready.

5- Go to the directory where the xampp program is and find htdocs folder in this directory. 
  
6- Move the project folder on github to the htdocs directory.
    
7- it's ready. You can reach the home page at http://localhost/project/index.php and admin page at http://localhost/project/admin/panel.php
